````
A balanced array is defined to be an array where for every value n in the array, -n also is in the
array. For example {-2, 3, 2, -3} is a balanced array. So is {-2, 2, 2, 2}. But {-5, 2, -2} is not
because 5 is not in the array.
Write a function named isBalanced that returns 1 if its array argument is a balanced array.
Otherwise it returns 0.
If you are programming in Java or C#, the function signature is
int isBalanced (int [ ] a);
If you are programming in C or C++, the function signature is
int isBalanced(int a[ ], int len) where len is the number of elements in the array.
